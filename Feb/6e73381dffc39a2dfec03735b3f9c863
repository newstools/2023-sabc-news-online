Thirty one bags loaded with dagga worth over R1 million were confiscated by the police at a farm in Delmas, Mpumalanga. Police say they noticed three suspicious-looking vehicles inside a maize field during a visit to the farm and as they approached, two of the vehicles managed to flee. SAPS spokesperson Selvey Mohlala says one vehicle remained and was found loaded with bags of dagga. Mohlala says, “Our reports indicate that members of the farmwatch were visiting their counterparts when they noticed three vehicles inside the maize field. When they came closer to the vehicles to investigate, two bakkies sped off leaving a blue ford SUV behind.” “As they approached the SUV and knocked on the window of the car, the driver opened the door and fled the scene on foot leaving the vehicle behind. When the car was inspected, police discovered 31 bags loaded with dagga. Police confiscated the dagga as well as the vehicle,” Mohlala says. #sapsMP Anti-Crime Farm Watch did a great job when 344 kilograms of dagga worth abt R1 387 702 million in street value recovered in a farm outside Delmas on Mnday, 20/2/23.
