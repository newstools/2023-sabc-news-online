Gauteng Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Solly Msimanga has accused Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors in the City of Tshwane of anarchistic behaviour after they stormed council offices on Thursday, to demand the removal of members of mayoral committees and political staff. The EFF is adamant that Randall Williams is no longer the Tshwane executive mayor following his resignation on Monday. The party says his mayoral committee had to vacate the office with him. The DA’s Williams handed in his resignation letter on Monday and later in the day submitted an amended one. Speaker of Council, Murunwa Makwarela on Wednesday confirmed that he had accepted the amended letter which would allow Williams and the mayoral committee to serve until the end of the month. Msimanga says the EFF thrives on disregarding processes. He says, “If they were not convinced that Randall’s resignation is legal on Monday or on the 28th, they could have approached a court of law, but clearly, anarchy is what they thrive on and this is why they doing what they doing,” he says. “There are councillors that have been manhandled; there are councillors that have pressed charges there, against fellow councillors. We should be all focusing on issues of service delivery. We should be talking about a turn-around strategy in that particular municipality,” Msimanga adds.
