The Department of Water and Sanitation says it may consider opening more Vaal Dam sluice gates should there be a further increase in water pressure. It follows heavy rains which caused rivers, that feed into the Vaal and Orange River systems, to overflow. Twelve floodgates have been opened so far. Some houses, situated along the riverbanks in Vereeniging, are submerged in water. The department’s Acting Deputy Director-General of Regulation Compliance and Enforcement, Leonardo Manus says, “If we see an increase in levels then we might have to open a few more. We do have the water control officers who are using their WhatsApp groups. We should be in a good space for the remainder of this calendar year. However, the demand is also a bit higher than what it is supposed to be, especially in the Gauteng area. We are working with Rand Water to see how we can bring the demand down.” The audio file below is reporting more on the story:
