Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola has told the Democratic Alliance (DA) that the African National Congress (ANC) will continue with its cadre deployment to rebuild state-owned entities. Lamola says cadre deployment has worked in the past at Eskom and the South African Revenue Services (Sars). He used former Eskom CEO Thulani Gcabashe and former Sars Commissioner Pravin Gordhan as two examples. Lamola said this when he closed the Joint Debate on President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address (SONA). “Let me remind, the DA, when Eskom was named as the global power company of the year it was not under apartheid. It was led by the ANC in 2002 … by the Financial Times’ global energy awards, the CEO was Thulani Gcabashe. The South African Revenue Services, not long ago, was on the best revenue tax collection services in the world, and the commissioner was none other than Pravin Gordhan. This shows that cadre deployment works. We have done it before, and we will do it again to rebuild state-owned entities,” adds Lamola. Below is Wednesday’s Sona debate proceedings:
