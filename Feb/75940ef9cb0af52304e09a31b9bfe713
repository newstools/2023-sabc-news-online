Eskom has implemented Stage 5 rolling blackouts from 5am on Sunday morning, until further notice. The Power Utility says it will publish a full statement in due course. On Saturday, Eskom confirmed that the grid was close to stage 8 blackouts last week and on Wednesday, they confirmed that it had dipped into the zone for stage 7. They said they had not yet introduced higher stages of power cuts and are currently assessing the situation. Eskom added that it has seen changes in demand patterns with high consumption in certain areas. The power utility has once again reminded consumers to switch off all non-essential electrical appliances during rolling blackouts to avoid power surges when the power returns. Failure to do so may lead to unnecessary trips or damages to household appliances when the supply is restored.
