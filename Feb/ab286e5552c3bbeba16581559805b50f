Communal livestock farmers in the Mhinga area, northern side of the Kruger National Park, in Limpopo say they are losing their cattle to rustlers from Mozambique. The farmers say the rustlers cut the park fence and drive their cattle into Mozambique. A few weeks ago, rangers intercepted a herd of cattle being driven through the park. No one has been arrested. The communal farmers say some of their livestock have been found in the villages in Mozambique. They say livestock theft is affecting their livelihoods. “I lost five cattle I am so distressed what bothers me is that it appears the thieves are in cahoots with rangers in the park there is nothing that I can do now because I lost a lot of money, and my children are sitting at home because there is no way they can go to school because they stole the cows I used to support them with,” a farmer says.
