The South African National AIDS Council (Sanac) has condemned alleged theft of antiretroviral (ARV) medication, worth R125 000, which was allegedly stolen from public health facilities in the Free State. Two separate cases were reported by the Bloemfontein SAPS, where boxes of ARVs were found in the possession of private persons. Sanac’s Co-Chairperson Steve Letsike says, “How is the department not beefing up security? It cannot be something that is acceptable for us as a council to observe this happening continuously when the medicine meant for patients who need it to live longer gets stolen by criminals. That is what we are condemning.” One of those found in possession of the medication was identified as an employee of the Free State health department.
