VIDEO: Another teenager shot in alleged gang-related violence in Westbury A Westbury resident describes daily life in the area. “Our kids live two minutes away from school, but they cannot walk by themselves. My daughter is in matric, but we have to walk her like she’s still a baby. We are prisoners because we have to keep our children indoors 24/7. Just to make sure that they are safe. Even your gate, even if it’s open like that you find something to close it so that it looks like no one is home,” a resident explains. Westbury gang violence: Peace talks stalled
