President Cyril Ramaphosa says the new electricity minister will co-ordinate with other departments and entities, but will ultimately be responsible for ending rolling blackouts. He was addressing a Joint Sitting of Parliament when he replied to the debate on his State of the Nation Address (SONA) at the Cape Town City Hall. Ramaphosa says, “The reality is that a resolution of the energy crisis requires effective co-ordination across departments and entities. It requires the undivided attention of a political principal who does not need to split their time, their energies amongst different important responsibilities.” He says the appointment will ensure that there is a minister who is ultimately responsible for resolving load shedding and who is able to work with all fellow cabinet ministers, departments and entities.
