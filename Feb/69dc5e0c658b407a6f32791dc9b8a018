The Centre for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CEI) at the University of the Western Cape says it hopes that the Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana will make provision for Small Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) when he delivers his budget speech on Wednesday afternoon. The CEI director, Abe Oliver, says SMMEs make a significant contribution to South Africa’s economy but financing them remains a huge challenge . Oliver says, “The load shedding and COVID has added to less customers, less production taking place. It’s great to hear that there is a plan to provide R1.4 billion financing for over 90 000 entrepreneurs, but a challenge is, what is the criteria? Because small businesses are waiting in hope then just to be made aware that they don’t meet the necessary requirements.” VIDEO: Durban business owners eagerly awaiting Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana’s budget speech:
