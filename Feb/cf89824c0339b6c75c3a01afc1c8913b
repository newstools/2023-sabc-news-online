Business Leadership South Africa (BLSA) says the budget addressed the country’s critical problem areas while retaining fiscal discipline. The BLSA says Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana, tabled a budget which is able to bring down the fiscal deficit without resorting to tax increases. BLSA CEO Busisiwe Mavuso says they are also relieved that concrete measures are finally being taken, to address the debt that municipalities and residents owe Eskom. Mavuso says, “And it was a sensible budget which tried to make sure there was something for everyone in it. There was something for SMMEs, there was something for businesses broadly, there was something for grant recipients, for employees and for homeowners. It was really balanced and the markets will react positively because he addressed the country’s critical problem areas while maintaining fiscal discipline.” Budget 2023 | Mixed reaction to the tabled budget
