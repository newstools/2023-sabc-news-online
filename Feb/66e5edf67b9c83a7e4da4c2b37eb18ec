Crime stats release:  Seven thousand five hundred and fifty-five murders were committed, almost 700 more than in the previous quarter. Police Minister Bheki Cele says while the use of firearms when committing murders are high, the overall violent behaviour of South Africans is a matter of concern. “3144 killed with firearms. 2800 killed with other sharp objects, like knives or other even bear hands. clear broader convo must be had about what is at heart of violent crimes in the country,” adds Cele.
