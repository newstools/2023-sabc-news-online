The National Taxi Council, SANTACO, is planning a stay-away in the Western Cape tomorrow. SANTACO’s provincial General-Secretary, Ryno Saaiers, says the protest is against the impounding of minibus taxis for traffic violations, while drivers wait for permits. “The impoundment of our vehicles for minor infringements by the City of Cape Town under their new by-laws and the marginalisation of the taxi industry. The latest is more than 2000 operating licences were issued without consulting with the taxi industry. It’s all unfair in the taxi industry. They have moved one step in the right direction by agreeing to engage with SANTACO. Our instruction to our members is keep your vehicles at home or at the taxi rank. There is no movement.” The taxi association has advised operators to refrain from engaging in acts of violence. Video: SANTACO planning a stay-away in the Western Cape
