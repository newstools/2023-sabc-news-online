The Mangaung Concerned Community (MCC) in Bloemfontein has again called for the dissolution of the Metro. This follows the Auditor-General’s damning report on the financial affairs of the Mangaung Metro in the 2021/22 financial year. According to AG report, Mangaung has regressed to a qualified audit opinion from an unqualified one in the previous financial year. It also says the metro spent R1.8-billion in unauthorised expenditure. MCC leader Themba Zweni says residents cannot continue to pay for basic services that are sub-standard. “We expected this outcome, we expected the regression. We are expecting worse. If you are to check the performance of the intervention team from April last year until today, I’m telling you we are expecting worse. This municipality is left with nothing, but it has to be dissolved. As residents, we now have to take steps to ensure that this municipality gets out of this. We cannot keep on paying to an ill-disciplined municipality.” Meanwhile, the cash-strapped metro continues to operate without permanent senior managers. Opposition parties in the besieged council have since put the blame on the factional battles of the ANC.
