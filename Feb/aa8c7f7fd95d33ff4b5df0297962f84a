Chairperson of the organisation, Umhlabuyalingana Society Against Crime, in northern KwaZulu-Natal, has been gunned down. Juda Mthethwa was killed when he arrived home on Thursday night. Mthethwa was at the forefront in the fight against cross-border crime in areas around uMkhanyakude. The crime involved the theft of motor vehicles which were taken across the border to Mozambique. It is alleged that over the past few months there has been an increase in hijackings targeting SUVs and bakkies in uMkhanyakude. Resident of the area, Musa Mthembu says, “I can confirm that Mr Juda Mthethwa was murdered last night around half past nine. Apparently, he was coming from Durban to fetch his kid. It is not known for now what could be the reason for his murder, but Juda was an activist fighting against crime that is currently persistent in our area, that of taking vehicles across to Mozambique.” Earlier today, police top brass briefed the police oversight committee on the latest crime figures for the period between October and December last year. The figures show that 7 555 people were reported murdered in the country between October and December last year. These figures show that at least 80 people were killed daily during the period under review. Major General Norman Sukhukhune says all provinces showed an increase in murders, except for Limpopo.
