The crisis in the City of Tshwane has further deepened the political fallout over the Mayor, Randall Williams’ resignation. This after the cancellation of the Special Tshwane Council sitting on Wednesday. Opposition parties in Tshwane are now threatening to prevent all Tshwane Mayoral Committee Members from accessing Tshwane’s house following the mayor’s resignation. They say the Mayoral Committee, collapsed on Monday at midnight when the mayor’s first resignation letter was affected. They have rejected Williams’ second letter to only vacate the office end of this month. Political crisis deepens in City of Tshwane  Tshwane’s Speaker was caught between a rock and a hard place. He is left to manage the political fallout and public uncertainty in the city. Makwarela says the cancelled council meeting is linked to a wrong annexure from the independent Audit and Performance Committee (APC). “He says the Tshwane Mayoral Committee first needs to meet over the error before Council can sit,” Makwarela explains.  Some of the Coalition partners are unhappy with how the Mayor’s resignation is handled. Expressing their dismay, the ANC and EFF say the cancelled Council meeting is to allow the DA to buy time to salvage the tensions in the multi-party coalition and protect the jobs of the MMCs. While the speaker says there’s no date on when a new mayor will be elected yet, he also wants heads to roll over the scathing AG report. Meanwhile, the vulnerability of the multi-party coalition is another concern as new proposals and deals are being made behind the scenes. It now remains to be seen how exactly the political impasse in the capital city will be resolved before service delivery that’s already compromised, takes a further knock.
