Trade union Solidarity says it has launched a legal challenge against the government’s decision to declare a National State of Disaster regarding electricity supply. During his State of the Nation Address last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a National State of Disaster as the country endures high levels of rolling blackouts. Solidarity’s Deputy Chief Executive for Legal Matters, Anton van der Bijl says, “We filed papers on Tuesday. In essence, it is a review application where we asked that the decision by the COGTA minister and Disaster Management Council to declare a National State of Disaster, we say it is irrational and illegal for them to do so. If you look at the Disaster Management Act, it is clear that in order for a crisis to be called the National State of Disaster, it must be unforeseen. If you look at the last 16 years, the government has basically ensured that there is a crisis.” Ramaphosa also announced his intention to appoint a Minister of Electricity in the Presidency to work with Eskom’s leadership on ending power cuts.
