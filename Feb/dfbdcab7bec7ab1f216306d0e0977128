The Azanian People’s Organisation (Azapo) has paid tribute to the late Black Consciousness Movement leader and anti-apartheid activist, Peter Jones. He died on Wednesday at his Pringle Bay home in the Western Cape after suffering a stroke. Jones was 72 years old. The struggle veteran was the last black person to see Steve Biko alive. In 1977, Jones and Biko, who were both leaders of the Black People’s Convention, were arrested at a roadblock near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape where they were separated. Jones only learnt of Biko’s death much later. Azapo member, Monelo Bongo says, “Peter’s passing doesn’t mean that Black Consciousness is dead. Peter’s death is just a phase of how those who are left behind should carry the philosophy further, and also leave it with younger people who can take over and run the organisations that are there. Because life cannot stop with us, life just continues.” The video below pays tribute to Peter Jones:
