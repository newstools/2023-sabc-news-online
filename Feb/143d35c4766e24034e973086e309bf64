The Judicial Conduct Tribunal into the alleged gross misconduct of Judge Tintswalo Makhubele is expected to begin in Rosebank, north of Johannesburg this morning. Judge Makhubele is implicated in gross misconduct for allegedly holding dual status as a judge and as chair of the PRASA Board. It’s believed that she also took action to allegedly undermine the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa), furthering corruption at the institution. Judge Makhubele is accused of crippling Prasa’s legal services departments during her capacity as board chairperson, rendering it inoperable. It believed she allegedly attempted to circumvent legal advice from the department by trying to force a settlement agreement with Siyaya DB Consulting Engineers. Siyaya is owned by Makhensa Mabhunda, a notorious agent implicated in State Capture. The company has gained more than R5-billion through contracts with Prasa, many of which were allegedly corrupt. In 2017, Siyaya claimed R56-million from Prasa and Judge Makhubele allegedly ordered attorneys to settle the matter and excluded the rail service’s legal services department from the process.
