Former paralympic superstar athlete Oscar Pistorius will spend the tenth anniversary of the death of Reeva Steenkamp, behind bars. Pistorius, who is known as “Blade Runner” for his carbon-fiber prosthetic legs, was jailed in 2016 for killing Steenkamp. He went from public hero to convicted murderer in a trial that drew worldwide interest. Pistorius, who was once the darling of the Paralympic movement for pushing for greater recognition and acceptance of disabled athletes, shot dead Steenkamp, a model and law student, in his bathroom in 2013. Pistorius was initially given a six-year jail term but after prosecutors’ appeal, the term was increased to 13 years. Oscar Pistorius now eligible for parole in March 2023: Karyn Maughn
