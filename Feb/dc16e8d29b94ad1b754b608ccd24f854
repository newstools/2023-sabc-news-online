Civil society organisation, Judges Matter says there could be serious consequences from the Judicial Conduct Tribunal into embattled former PRASA interim board chairperson, Judge Tintswalo Makhubele’s conduct. Makhubele is accused of breaching the separation of powers principle by serving as a judge of the High Court while being chairperson of PRASA. The tribunal was adjourned on Friday – until May. Research and Advocacy Officer at Judges Matter,  Mbekezeli Benjamin says “This tribunal is focused on the conduct of the judge- so it’s called a judicial conduct tribunal- and for her there are likely to be very serious consequences, because if she’s found guilty- then she might be impeached and removed from office. So, those are quite serious consequences- and which is why the tribunal is set up. The tribunal is only set up to deal with the most serious complaints complaints against a judge. That’s the likely outcome of this.”
