The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has voiced concerns that some private security companies are refusing to pay service providers, resulting in over 30 000 security guards being unable to access medical insurance and other benefits. In a statement, Numsa says companies are deducting money from workers, but refusing to pay the service providers. Unions’ National Spokesperson, Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says, “We are talking about at least R50 million of deductions which had not being paid over, according to some of the investigations that had taken place around the issue, but it could actually be higher because there are hundreds of thousand of security guards who are not registered.” “What you have in South Africa is that, you’ve got the bargaining council for security guards, but there are still hundreds and thousands of security guards who are not formally registered as part of the bargaining council,” she adds.
