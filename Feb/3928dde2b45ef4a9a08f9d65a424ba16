Communications Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says the SABC has started taking advantage of the increase in the number of channels on the Digital Terrestrial Television platform. Ntshavheni was speaking during the joint State of the Nation Address Debate at the Cape Town City Hall. “SABC News has launched a 24-hour news channel on the DTT platform on all indigenous languages, meaning that for the first time in the history of broadcasting in this country, millions of South Africans no longer wait for evening news bulletins and current affairs to receive news and information in their own languages. We are engaging the regulator, Icasa, to make sure that we find mechanism to ease  the participation of more content producers as  television channel owners. The technology is ready to increase channel capacity on the DTT platform.” SONA 2023 Debate | Praise and criticism for President Ramaphosa continue on Day 2:
