Kwazulu-Natal Police Commissioner Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi says no arrests have yet been made in connection with the murder of Kiernan Forbes. The rapper, also known as AKA, was gunned down in Durban last weekend alongside his longtime friend and manager, Tebello “Tibs” Motsoane, after leaving a restaurant. No arrests as yet in AKA’s murder:  Mkhwanazi was speaking at a media briefing in Parliament, where Police Minister Bheki Cele and police top brass, released the latest crime figures. The memorial for the musician is currently under way at the Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. Family, fans and fellow musicians are in attendance. Live proceedings below:
