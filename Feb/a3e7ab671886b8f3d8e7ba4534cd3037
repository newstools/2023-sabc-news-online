Advocate Dali Mpofu has accused Parliament’s Chairperson of the Section 194 Committee of being a bully. The committee is probing suspended Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Mkhwebane’s legal team, led by Mpofu, asked for a letter from the committee to be discussed. They allege the letter, addressed to Mkhwebane regarding the payment of her legal team, consists of lies and distortions. However, Chairperson Qubudile Dyantyi has insisted that the letter be responded to in writing and that the questioning of today’s witness commence. Mpofu then accused him of applying bullying tactics. “If you are going to have bully-boy tactics and force us to do things, you will stay with your comm [committee]. Because we are asking to clarify issues after you insulted Public Protector, but you are just bullying us,” charged Mpofu. Dyantyi insists that the response to the letter be done in writing. “I’m going to be clear, today we are not discussing letters … ask (the) team to ask questions to the witness, Biance Mvuyana.” Below is the live stream:
