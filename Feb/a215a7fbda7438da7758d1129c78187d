South Africa has been added to the greylist by the international financial watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF announced the decision on Friday afternoon following a five-day plenary meeting in Paris. The body had previously found that South Africa scored poorly when it came to having rigorous laws relating to anti-money laundering and the countering of financing terrorism.
