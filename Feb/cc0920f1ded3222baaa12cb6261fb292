Black Consciousness leader, Peter Cyril Jones, passed away on Wednesday at his Pringle Bay home in the Western Cape after suffering a stroke. He was 72. The struggle veteran was the last black person to see Steve Biko alive. In 1977, Jones and Biko who were both leaders of the Black People’s Convention were arrested at a roadblock near Grahamstown. They were then separated. He found out about Biko’s death much later. Jones later served as the Vice President of AZAPO. Tributes are pouring in for Comrade PC as he was affectionately known at his Pringle Bay home. In 2019, Jones suffered a major stroke that left him incapacitated. His family says he will be sorely missed. His wife, Ingrid Jones, says the black consciousness stalwart will be remembered as a freedom fighter Peter Jones’ wife, Ingrid Jones says, “He was the eternal revolutionary and I think that is how he would like to be remembered. And talking to people out there, it was that thing of not being legendary, but leaving something for others to emulate so that we move black people and the plight of black people forward as opposed to just sitting in your misery without looking into the future.” Azapo member Monelo Bongo also pays tribute to Jones. “AZAPO member, Monelo Bongo Peter’s passing doesn’t mean that black consciousness is dead. Peter’s death is just a phase of how we those who are left behind should carry the philosophy further and also leave it with younger people who can take over and run the organisations that are there, because life cannot stop with us, life just continues.”
