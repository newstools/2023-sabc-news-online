Government has conceded that it is losing the battle against crime, despite the increase in the arrest of king pins.
This was revealed by Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele who briefed the media on the outcomes of Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting. Gungubele also defended the action by the police when the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MPs stormed the podium last week when President Cyril Ramaphosa was delivering the State of the Nation Address. He says the security does not prophesy it observes the situation and decide whether to react or be pro-active. Minister in the Presidency says the behaviour of the EFF members was posing a security threat to the President. Gungubele was briefing journalists in Cape Town on the outcomes of the cabinet meeting. “I thought EFF was leaving. Even myself, I was taken by surprise that they find themselves on the stage. Now the question I am asking is if even myself I was surprised by seeing them getting on the stage, I was not sure what other surprise would occur. So, police act to make sure that the security is…and I think many South Africans general are happy with the way the police have acted in that manner,” Gungubele reiterates. VIDEO:
