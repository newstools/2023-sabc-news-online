Editorial Note: This story has been changed. Previously it was reported that President Cyril Ramaphosa has only a day left to meet the February 28 deadline that the Constitutional Court has imposed on him to sign the Electoral Amendment Bill. This has been corrected in the updated story. Parliament’s extended Constitutional Court deadline to amend the Electoral Act will end on Tuesday. In June 2020, the court gave Parliament 24 months to rectify the defect in the Act following the New Nation Movement’s successful court. The court declared the Act unconstitutional as it only required adult citizens to become Members of the National Assembly or the Provincial Legislatures through political party membership. Parliament missed the first deadline of June 2020 and asked for a six-month extension. The Bill provides for independent candidates to also contest elections at both provincial and national levels. VIDEO | Ramaphosa has three days to approve the Electoral Amendment Bill: Terry Tselane  Executive Chairperson of the Institute of Election Management Services in Africa, Terry Tselane says, “The Constitutional Court had given Parliament 24 months to review the electoral legislation in order to ensure that other citizens are able to participate as independents rather than through membership of the political party.” He adds, “That 24 months were eventually extended, and clearly, the time that the IEC requires to implement the processes leading up to the 2024 elections has been seriously constrained and I am certain that the president is well aware of the implications of not finalising this. In my opinion, it is better to have a bad legislation than not to have a legislation at all.” VIDEO | Civil society groups urge President Ramaphosa not to sign the Electoral Amendment Bill
