Economic Freedom Fighters Spokesperson, Sinawo Tambo says they were “approached by the minister of police” in relation to the alleged assassination plot against the party’s Secretary-General Marshall Dlamini, by leaders of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). “We were approached by the minister of police and he’s the one who told our secretary-general,” says Tambo. “The minister of police called the secretary-general of the EFF and told him there’s escalating political violence in KZN and that means they targeted him due to the decision that the EFF has taken to remove the IFP,” adds Tambo.

But what is important is to emphasise that as the SAPS, we do not discuss the safety, security, and threats assessments of individuals in the public domain,” says Athlenda Mathe, SAPS Spokesperson.
