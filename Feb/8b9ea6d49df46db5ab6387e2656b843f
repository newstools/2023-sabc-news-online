Eskom has implemented Stage 4 rolling blackouts from 9am on Sunday until further notice. The power utility says it will publish a full statement in due course. Eskom says rolling blackouts are implemented to protect the national electricity network by balancing supply and demand. “If this is not done, the national grid will shut down entirely and the entire country will be blacked out for days to weeks.”
