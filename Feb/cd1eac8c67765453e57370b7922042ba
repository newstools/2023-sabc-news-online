The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Eastern Cape says the State of the Province Address (SOPA) was not in touch with the realities of the province. Eastern Cape Premier, Oscar Mabuyane called on the private sector to continue investing in the province to strengthen its economy and improve the living conditions of residents. Mabuyane delivered his fourth SOPA at the Bhisho Legislature on Friday, where he also said his administration is committed to fighting unemployment, inequality and poverty, the province’s biggest challenges. The DA’s Bobby Stevenson says the SOPA failed to outline the inefficiencies in service delivery in the province. He says, “That’s a complete fairytale that denies the harsh reality under which people love their daily lives in the Eastern cape. The fact that there was no water in the legislature today and its been like that most of the week highlights that even in the centre of governance in the Eastern Cape, service delivery has collapsed.” VIDEO: Eastern Cape State of the Province Address:
