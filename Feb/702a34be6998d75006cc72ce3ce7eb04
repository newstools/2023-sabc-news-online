Security has been beefed up at Tshwane House in Pretoria after Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members stormed the offices of several Mayoral Committee members and the Chief of Staff on Thursday. Security and Metro Police had to intervene. The party demands that all MMCs vacate office immediately. The EEF says the Tshwane Mayoral Committee collapsed on Monday at midnight when the outgoing Mayor Randall Williams’s first resignation came into effect. Community Safety MMC Grandi Theunissen was one of the first to be forcefully ejected from his office. The fighters also attempted to carry out the Mayor’s Chief of Staff. Tshwane mayor’s Chief of Staff Jordan Griffiths says, “The party insists that the Mayoral Committee doesn’t exist anymore, and a new Mayor and MMCs must take over.” Tshwane EFF chairperson Obakeng Ramabodu says, “The EFF also took to the offices of the Speaker demanding legal evidence which sanctioned the Mayor’s second resignation letter. The second letter allows the Mayor to vacate office by February 28th. The ANC called for a special council sitting to be prioritised.” The African National Congress (ANC) regional secretary George Matjila says, “The safety of workers is a primary concern. Municipal union SAMWU says workers’ safety will not be compromised.” SAMWU Tshwane Regional Chairperson, Nkhetheni Muthavhi says, “Meanwhile, the Tshwane Speaker is also under pressure to urgently convene a special council sitting to pave the way for the election of a new mayor.”
