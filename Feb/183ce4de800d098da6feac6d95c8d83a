The South African Weather Service (SAWS) has issued an orange Level 5 weather warning that might affect parts of Gauteng, especially the southern part of the province. This implies the possibility of heavy downpours with destructive floods in parts of Gauteng. Floods in the province have claimed the lives of four people, damaged houses and businesses and washed away roads and bridges in Tshwane and Ekurhuleni over the past week. SAWS Forecaster, Dipuo Tawana says isolated thundershowers are expected to continue across Gauteng for the next few days and possibly into the weekend. Tawana says, “We are having what we call a continental low pressure system over Botswana that is bringing in tropical moisture together with surface troughs over the western interior. For the northern parts and rest of the interior, we have a Level 2 that is disruptive rainfall and it will be localised flooding of some areas and informal settlements, and one other reason is that in most areas the ground is still wet from the amount of rainfall we received. This is going to make the rainfall run off because the ground is still saturated.” VIDEO: Recent heavy rains and weather patterns are due to climate change:
