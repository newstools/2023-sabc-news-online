Rescuers worked through the night to rescue people clinging to life beneath the rubble eight days after Türkiye’s worst earthquake in modern history but hopes of finding many more survivors were fading on Tuesday. A boy and a man were rescued in hard-hit Kahramanmaras early on Tuesday, 198 hours after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck on February 6. Elsewhere in Kahramanmaras, rescuers were attempting to reach a grandmother, mother and daughter, all from one family, who appeared to have survived the quake and aftershock that killed more than 37,000 in Türkiye and Syria. But others were bracing for the inevitable scaling down of operations as low temperatures reduced the already slim chances of survival, with some Polish rescuers announcing they would leave on Wednesday. In the shattered Syrian city of Aleppo, United Nations (UN) aid chief Martin Griffiths said the rescue phase was “coming to a close”, with the focus switching to shelter, food and schooling. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had agreed to allow more UN aid to access the war-torn country from Turkey, diplomats said late on Monday. Türkiye media said rescuers held out hope of finding survivors at several locations in Kahramanmaras province, Adiyaman and Hatay, where there were signs of life beneath the ruins. But in the southern city of Antakya, excavators began tearing down heavily damaged buildings and clearing rubble. Blue lights from ambulances lit up the dim streets where there was still no power and the smell of smoke filled the air. Hundreds of people are leaving the city every day, and those who remain huddle around fires on street corners and in parks, and sleep in tents or cars. As they worked through the night, rescue workers occasionally called for silence as they listened for the faintest sound of life from under the rubble.
