Organisation representing hostel dwellers, Ubunye bamahostela Spokesperson, Mthembiseni Thusi is calling for calm in hostels around KwaZulu-Natal. This comes after the shooting incident that left four people dead and five others injured at KwaMashu hostel north of Durban on Wednesday. It’s alleged that a group of 20 armed suspects stormed into the hostel and opened fire to the unsuspecting victims. Three people died at the scene while a fourth person died at a local clinic. Police say the search for the 20 armed men who were involved in the shooting is still under way. Thusi is also calling on traditional leaders from areas where most hostel dwellers come from, to intervene and address the issue of violence with their subjects. He says, “What happened at KwaMashu is embarrassing. We wish the those affected by this incident will not pay a revenge because that will perpetuate the already volatile situation leading to unnecessary killing. Conflicts in hostels will always be there since most of us come from different places, but we do not encourage this manner of resolving quarrels. We have been calling on traditional leaders to play a pivotal role in ending these fights by calling meeting with their people who resides in these hostel to no avail.” VIDEO: SAPS confirms death of a fourth person in KwaMashu hostel shooting:
