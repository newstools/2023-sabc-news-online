Political party Abantu Batho Congress (ABC) has joined Action SA’s court bid to force the eThekwini Municipality to fix its wastewater systems. From the last quarter of 2022 the municipality has been battling with a sewerage crisis. This led to Action SA approaching the courts to force eThekwini Municipality to repair water and sanitation infrastructure. The sewage spill resulted in the closure of many beaches along the coastline due to high e-coli levels. ABC president Philani Mavundla says he’s written to municipal officials on the dangers posed by the ailing infrastructure but says he’s been ignored. He claims to be in possession of reports dating before last year’s crippling floods on this crisis. Mavundla says eThekwini Municipality has also lost R1.7 billion of revenue through water mismanagement. The matter will be heard in the KwaZulu-Natal high court on Monday.
