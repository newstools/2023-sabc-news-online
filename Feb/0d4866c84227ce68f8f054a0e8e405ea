Survivors tell a tale of continuous disregard for human life and the rules of the road. “Is this company only happy to just take money from people? Even if I go back in my mind those at the weigh bridge will release even the worst scrap of a bus it will somehow just get through officials. We are now scared of buses,” explains one survivor. Other survivors narrate their dissatisfaction with the operations of the bus company. Transport authorities say that they will launch a probe into the bus company. Local municipal authorities say the survivors’ revelations are news to them. Authorities say that some have indicated that burials will take place from Friday until Sunday following engagements with some families of the deceased.
