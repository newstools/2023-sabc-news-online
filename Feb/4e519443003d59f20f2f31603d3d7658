Minister of Health Dr. Joe Phaahla has announced the first death related to recent cases of cholera in South Africa. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases has increased to five. It comes after three cases were announced weeks ago. The 4th case is a 28-year-old male residing in Alexandra Township with no local or international travel history. The patient presented himself at the Edenvale Hospital Emergency Centre with a four-day history of diarrhea, vomiting and body weakness. A specimen was collected for testing and the patient was not admitted to the hospital but managed as an outpatient and given treatment to take home, and requested to return for his results which came back positive. The outbreak response team conducted a case investigation and visited the patientâ€™s residence and workplace the following day. The 5th case is a 24-year-old male residing in Emandleni Wattville, Benoni in Ekurhuleni with no travel history. The patient presented with profuse watery diarrhea and was admitted to Tambo Memorial Hospital. His results confirmed positive status and he passed away a few days later. One of his contacts is still in hospital and further investigation is being conducted. Cholera mainly spreads through contaminated or polluted water. People can become infected directly through drinking contaminated water, or indirectly through eating contaminated food. Symptoms include diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting and body weakness.
