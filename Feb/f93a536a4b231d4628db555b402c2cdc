Mobile network operator, Telkom, has announced its intention to begin a formal retrenchment process that could affect 15% of its workforce. The group has indicated that it would initiate cost-cutting measures as it looks to restructure some of its operations. It says this is as a result of the difficult trading environment in South Africa. The General-Secretary of the Communications Workers Union (CWU) Aubrey Tshabalala says they have identified a trend where Telkom implement retrenchments as a way to reward executives. Tshabalala says, “At Telkom we are looking at just above 2000 workers, if you have to include some of the small subsidiaries of Telkom. I also have to indicate that Telkom sent us an invite to a meeting just an hour before the meeting yesterday (Tuesday) where they eventually announced that they are intending to retrench these workers.” “In the previous years, just after the retrenchments, bonuses were given to the CEO and executives. If this is not stopped, in 2025 we will be experiencing the same thing where Telkom will come with the same excuse because that has been the business model that they have been using,” he adds.
