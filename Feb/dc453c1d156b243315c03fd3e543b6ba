Both horns from both carcasses were hacked off. A case of illegal hunting of a protected animal without a permit is under investigation.” Meanwhile, a 34-year-old Mozambican national, Santos Baloyi, was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Friday for rhino poaching.

The rangers heard gunshots not far from where they were patrolling, a shootout ensued between the poachers and the rangers after which Baloyi was shot in the leg and apprehended. The other two suspects fled the scene.
