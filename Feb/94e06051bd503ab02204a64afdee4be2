By-elections are taking place in two municipalities in the Western Cape on Wednesday. The Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) says there is a seat available in Ward Six of the Cederberg municipality that became available following the resignation of a councillor from the Cederberg First Residentsâ€™ Association (CeFRA). The councillor held the position since the Local Government Election in 2021, under a coalition government led by the Democratic Alliance (DA) and other community inspired parties. In the other local authority, a seat will be contested on Wednesday in Ward 33 of the Cape Agulhas municipality in the Overberg district on the west coast. It became available when the membership of a DA councillor was terminated by the party.
