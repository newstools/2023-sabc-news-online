Transnet says it has resumed limited train services on the branch lines in Witbank, Belfast, Lydenburg and Steelpoort in Mpumalanga. This after floods caused a massive service disruption last week. Operations have commenced across the Witbank to Richards Bay corridor. Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) says its teams are working on clearing staged trains and the backlog on the line, which is a major channel for the export of coal, chrome and ferrochrome. The decision to resume services follows the FTR engineers’ extensive safety exercise. In a statement, the company says it is still conducting repairs and rehabilitation of the remaining part of the rail network, notably the over border, regional links with Maputo and Eswatini.
