The Portfolio Committee on Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment has assured Limpopo community members that if the majority of South Africans don’t want the Climate Change Bill, it will not be passed in Parliament. The committee is in Limpopo as part of its nationwide consultation process with communities on the Climate Change Bill. According to the committee, the Bill will enable the development of an effective response to climate change and a just transition to low carbon emissions. Makwarela community members filled the hall to engage on the impact of climate change in their area. This community leader says while they are happy with the response from local government to disaster issues, they hope the bill will address challenges relating to climate change. “That area of Vhembe has a lot of issues of climate change and also the disasters in our area. I want this bill passed to create good work,” says Jeffery Masutha, community leader. The Portfolio Committee says the bill will complement other existing legislation. “We don’t want to create something parallel, the job of government is to complete not compete but what we want is what is written in the disaster act to find expression in the act,” says Pogiso Modise, committee chairperson. The inclusion of traditional leaders was among the issues raised during the committee’s visit. “What was raised critically in Sekhukhune, the people say that the bill does not speak about the incorporation of traditional leaders but the bill in its draft form does not speak to the role of traditional leaders because these are their first point of contact,” Modise added. The committee will move to Bela Bela on Sunday. VIDEO: Communities engaged on Climate Change Bill
