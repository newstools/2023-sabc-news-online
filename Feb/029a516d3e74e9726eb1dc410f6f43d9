President Cyril Ramaphosa has for the first time delivered a strong message on the current situation prevailing in the eastern part of the DRC. Millions have been displaced and thousands killed as M23 rebels and government forces fight a protracted war in that region. Delivering opening remarks as the chair of the AU Peace and Security Council, Ramaphosa says the volatile situation has gone for too long and the situation is untenable. He described the prevailing atmosphere in the eastern part of the DRC as a humanitarian catastrophe and horrifying violation of human rights. “The eastern DRC continues to experience periodic cycles of conflict and violence. To see people booted, women and girls violated.” “We have set ourselves an ambitious goal to Silence the Guns across Africa. To achieve this goal, we must show zero-tolerance for current and emerging conflicts and redouble our efforts to resolve them.” HE President @CyrilRamaphosa #SilencingTheGuns #TheAfricaWeWant  pic.twitter.com/Qbv6p2cHwk — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) February 17, 2023
