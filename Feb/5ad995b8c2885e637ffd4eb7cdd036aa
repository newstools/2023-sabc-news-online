The City of Tshwane council meeting set for today to discuss the two resignation letters from former Mayor Randall Williams has been cancelled. Williams resigned as Mayor on Monday and hours later submitted an amended letter indicating he will be stepping down at the end of this month. Speaker of Council Murunwa Makwarela was also going to consider an amended damning annual report. He was later told by the mayoral office that the report would not be ready to be tabled before council today. “The leader of executive business MMC Sutton wrote to me to say speaker we are not ready, so I cancelled that meeting, issued a new notice of special council to consider the two letters. I am now considering the second letter, report.”
