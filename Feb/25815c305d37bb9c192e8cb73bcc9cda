SABC News has learned that embattled Free State Premier, Sisi Ntombela, has resigned. Ntombela’s future has been hanging in the balance after she was defeated in the race for the Free State ANC chairperson position last month by Cooperative Governance MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana. The African National Congress (ANC) is expected to confirm Ntombela’s departure at a media briefing on the outcomes of the Special National Executive Committee meeting this morning in Johannesburg. Ntombela, Legislature speaker, Zanele Sifuba, and nine other MECs have failed to make it into the 35-member Free State ANC Provincial Executive Committee. The ANC is also expected to confirm the axing of Mangaung Metro executive mayor, Mxolisi Siyonzana, after he was recalled by the party’s regional structure in August last year. Meanwhile, the ANC in the Free State has submitted the names of newly elected provincial chairperson, Mxolisi Dukwana, his deputy, Ketso Makume, and the party’s provincial deputy secretary, Dibolelo Mahlatsi, as Ntombela’s possible replacements. However, Makume and Mahlatsi are not members of the Free State Legislature. The ANC in the Mangaung region has submitted the names of NCOP chief whip, Seiso Mohai, MK veteran and party PEC member, Gregory Nthatisi, and Free State ANC Women’s League convenor, Lulama Titi-Odili, to replace Mxolisi Siyonzana as Mangaung executive mayor. The party in the region also wants Mangaung deputy executive mayor, Mapaseka Mothibi-Nkoane, and council speaker, Stefani Lockman-Naidoo, to be axed.
