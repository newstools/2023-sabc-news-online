African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Fikile Mbalula, says the party’s Western Cape provincial conference will take place no later than the 8th of April this year. The province is the only one that has not yet held its conference. The conference has been postponed several times since August last year as the provincial ANC has been beset by administrative problems. Mbalula says the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) has agreed that it will deploy NEC members to the Western Cape to assist the Interim Provincial Committee to organise their conference. Mbalula told the media in Johannesburg that the Dullar Omar regional conference would take place after the provincial conference. “We endorsed a report that deals with the auditing of branches in the Western Cape to deploy a team of NEC members to the province to assist the IPC with the process of organising the provincial conference. The provincial conference to be convened no later than April 8th 2023.”
