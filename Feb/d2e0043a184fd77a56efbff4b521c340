The Gauteng Education Department says it will send psychologists to two schools marred by violence in the East and West Rand. A man was shot dead at Kagiso Secondary School when he attacked a teacher on Friday. In the East Rand, three men have appeared in court for the fatal stabbing of a grade 10 learner at Geluksdal Secondary School in Brakpan. The case was postponed to next week Wednesday.
