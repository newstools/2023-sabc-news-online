19 Bangladeshi nationals have been rescued by police from a house in Kamagugu outside Mbombela, in Mpumalanga on Monday. It is suspected that they were illegally smuggled into South Africa. Provincial police spokesperson Selvy Mohlala says a 55-year-old man accused of human trafficking has been arrested. “We have arrested one person from Bangladesh and we are charging him with human trafficking. Some of the Bangladesh nationals that we found here were told that they were destined for Middelburg and other for Johannesburg. This is not the end of our investigation, we will continue working hand in hand with the Department of Home Affairs. And we hope that the kingpins wherever they are, we will get them.” One person arrested for human trafficking in Mpumalanga, and 20 foreign nationals rescued:
