Gauteng Human Settlements and Infrastructure Development MEC Lebogang Maile refutes the Democratic Alliances (DA) Kingsol Chabalala’s allegations that the demolition of the HM Pitje Stadium in Mamelodi costs R84 million. The stadium was demolished on Friday last week after it had deteriorated and was being vandalised. In a statement, Maile says demolition cost R19 million. He has requested Chabalala to retract and apologise for misleading the public and the media. In a tweet Maile said, “Clearly the R84m is a figment of Chabalala’s imagination, no such amount was spent to demolish the stadium.” “We have a team of dedicated, ethical and competent men and women committed to serve the government and its people. Such false claims by irresponsible public representatives puts them in bad light,” concluded MEC Maile.
