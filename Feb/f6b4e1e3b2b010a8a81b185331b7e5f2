Mashatile says they are looking forward to their responsibilities as members of parliament. “We are deployed here by the ANC. We are here to implement the manifesto of the ANC. We are joining a team of other comrades who have already been here. So, we are going to work with them to ensure we serve the people well. We are going to be briefed by the Chief Whip of the majority party (about) what our responsibilities are going to be as members of parliament.” VIDEO | Four new ANC MPs to be sworn in today: Moloto Mothapo
