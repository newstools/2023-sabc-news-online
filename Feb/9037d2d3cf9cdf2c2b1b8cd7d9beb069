Member of the Mayoral Committee for Community Services and Health, Patricia Van der Ross, has urged parents and caregivers with children between the ages of six months and 14 years to have their kids vaccinated at one of the city’s clinics. “Some children do not receive these vaccinations for a host of reasons.
