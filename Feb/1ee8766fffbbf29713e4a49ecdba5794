Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, has criticised former Eskom CEO André de Ruyter’s recent utterances as unverified. De Ruyter resigned in December, citing a lack of political support in resolving the power utility’s energy crisis. However, the board announced on Wednesday that de Ruyter was leaving immediately. He also revealed in a TV interview his understanding of African National Congress (ANC) ministers’ and senior leaders’ alleged involvement in criminal activities at state-owned entities. The ANC has rejected De Ruyter’s corruption claims, saying that he failed to revamp Eskom. Gungubele says, “It is quite disturbing that a man of his statue joins the chorus of allegations whilst he is in a position which makes him a prescribed officer to assist South Africans in dealing with corruption in a more effective way, rather than mere allegations. It is just not correct for an official to send a message which is not verified or authenticated about government, especially in his capacity and in the position that he holds.” De Ruyter has the obligation to report knowledge of corruption to relevant authorities: Gungubele
