Deputy Minister of Transport Sindisiwe Chikunga says they will launch an investigation into the bus company involved in the fatal crash that claimed 21 lives outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo on Monday. Chikunga was speaking during an interaction with the survivors of the crash at Elim Hospital. Over 60 survivors were transported to various hospitals after sustaining severe injuries. The Deputy Minister says investigations will guide them on the cause of the crash. “What they are saying is indicating that the bus might not be roadworthy, but we are definitely going to do investigations to [be able to understand] what transpired. But definitely that’s what the investigation is about, they seem to be saying the bus driver was overtaking,” adds Chikunga. The video below is reporting on the bus crash:
