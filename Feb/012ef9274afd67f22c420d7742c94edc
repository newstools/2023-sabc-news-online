President Cyril Ramaphosa should fire his police minister, Bheki Cele. This was said by COPE reacting to the release of the latest crime figures for the period between October and December last year. Police top brass briefed the police oversight committee this morning. The figures show that 7 555 people were reported murdered in the country between October and December last year. These figures show that at least 80 people were killed daily during the period under review. Major General Norman Sukhukhune says all provinces showed an increase in murders, except for Limpopo. “For Eastern Cape, we have 1 501, more than previously recorded; same for Free State, 275 more than previous; GP 1721 more than previous quarter. Limpopo is 263 which is less than previous quarter,” says Sekhukhune. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says this is worrying. “People are being shot dead as if South Africa is a war zone. Nobody is safe, not even in one’s home. Police, religious leaders, music artists and ordinary citizens are targets of these thugs. We believe that the solution in the battle against crime is to remove the Minister of Police Bheki Cele. President Ramaphosa must put the interests of the country above the interest of his  comrades and fire this incompetent minister Bheki Cele.” Below is the live stream:  Cele and his top police brass are expected back in Parliament next week to discuss further the figures and their plans to fight crime.
