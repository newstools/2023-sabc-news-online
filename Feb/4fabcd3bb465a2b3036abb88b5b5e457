A Limpopo-based comedian accused of murdering his partner will apply for bail in the Thohoyandou Magistrates’ Court on Thursday morning. The accused, Livhuwani Madadzhe, 31 had earlier abandoned his bail application. Madadzhe is accused of killing his partner, Lindelani Nengovhela, and throwing her body in a pit toilet in the Mangodi-Ha-Sidou village. The deceased had opened a case of domestic violence against Livhuwani but withdrew it a day before she was killed. The accused is still in custody. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
