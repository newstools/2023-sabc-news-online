The Aviation Authority of South Africa says it has launched an investigation following a light aircraft crash that claimed one life next to the N14 highway in Centurion, south of Pretoria, earlier on Wednesday. The aircraft was on its way to the Lanseria Airport. Communications Manager at the South African Civil Aviation Authority, Sisa Majola explains, “The Accident and Incident Investigations Division (AIID) was informed of an aircraft accident earlier today. The accident occurred at Eagles Creek Aerodrome next to the N14 highway on the way to the Lanseria Aerodrome. There was one occupant onboard, who sustained fatal injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage. “The AIID does have investigators on-site to start the process of evidence collection and to gather more information that will define the size and scope of the investigation as well as the timeframe for the issuance of a final report. Should a critical safety issue be identified, the Investigating team will then immediately notify relevant parties so that appropriate action can be taken. A preliminary report will be issued within 30 days from the day,” Majola says.
