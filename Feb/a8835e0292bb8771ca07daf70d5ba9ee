The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State has suspended some Mangaung regional members who held a parallel conference in Bloemfontein late last year. The three members were served with suspension letters after releasing a statement on behalf of the party’s Regional Executive Committee (REC). The ANC in Mangaung region currently has two structures and both structures have since been issuing statements respectively. Fannie Lelimo, Patrick Manyakoane and Tonto Selebedi, who were on the forefront of the parallel ANC Mangaung regional conference in November last year, have been suspended with immediate effect. This after they released a statement on February 6th , citing various issues among other issues – the recalling of the premier and Mangaung mayor, the provincial conference and parallel structures within the region. The following day, the trio were served with notice of intention to suspend. Other REC members from this group, including the Mangaung Municipality deputy mayor Mapaseka Mothibi-Nkoane are walking on thin ice. They have been served with letters to confirm if they associate themselves with the said statement.
