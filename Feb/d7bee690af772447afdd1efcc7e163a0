Cabinet will make more interventions in the troubled Komani-based Enoch Mgijima Local Municipality (EMLM) in the Eastern Cape. Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, revealed this during a media briefing in Komani. Residents of the area have been calling for the dissolution of the local authority due to a general lack of basic services. They braved the chilly weather in the town to demonstrate on Thursday. Last week, Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma visited the town to engage with the community. Gungubele says Dlamini-Zuma and Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, briefed Cabinet on the municipality. He says, “The EMLM had been experiencing significant financial and service delivery failures for a long time before the intervention. Cabinet expressed its appreciation of the serious issues identified by stakeholders and has assured residents of the EMLM that a decision on how to address the municipality’s current challenges would be communicated soon.” VIDEO: Minister Gungubele briefs media on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting:
