Most crime categories have increased during the third quarter of 2022. This was revealed during the release of the latest statistics earlier on Friday. Police top brass briefed the police oversight committee on Friday morning. The figures show that 7 555 people were reported murdered in the country between October and December last year. These figures show that at least 80 people were killed daily during the period under review. The police’s head of crime research, Major-General Norman Sekhukhune, says all provinces showed an increase in murders, except for Limpopo. “For Eastern Cape, we have 1 501, more than previously recorded; same for Free State, 275 more than previous; Gauteng Province 1 721 more than previous quarter. Limpopo is 263 which is less than previous quarter,” says Sekhukhune. Three of the top five police stations with the highest number of murders are in the Western Cape. “The station with the highest murders recorded is Mfuleni 89, second Inanda in KwaZulu-Natal 87, Delft at three (with) 86 … Nyanga at No.: 5 with 68 murders. All top five murder stations have recorded increases compared to previous period.” MPs such as Henry Shembeni from the EFF, Andrew Whitfield from the DA, and Pieter Groenewald from the FF Plus, have all expressed concerns. “Where do [the firearms] come from? Across borders,” asks Shembeni. Whitfield has raised issues around accessibility to police stations in parts of Eastern Cape. Groenewald wants a breakdown of farm murders and attacks. Cele and his top police brass are expected back in Parliament next week to discuss further the figures and their plans to fight crime. Below is the live stream:
