A team of marine scientists will embark on an offshore expedition to develop the capacity of young Southern African scientists and to collect data in outer shelf and deep-sea habitats. The expedition team consists of emerging scientists, technicians and students from seven institutions in four provinces. It was designed by the emerging researchers and will contribute to several post graduate theses. In a statement, the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity (SANBI)  says the expedition is an excellent example of the teamwork needed to collectively understand, benefit from and manage South Africa’s oceans. SANBI Marine biologist, Luther Adams will lead the team of young researchers in the One Ocean Hub Capacity Development Research Cruise from the port of East London. Adams says, “This expedition is allowing me to achieve a life-long dream to explore South Africa’s oceans and to use modern technology and new techniques to uncover the secrets that lie far beneath the sea surface.”
