The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Mangaung have lambasted government officials for failing to properly implement interventions that have been brought in to restructure the embattled municipality. This follows a report by the Auditor General that Mangaung regressed to a qualified opinion in the 2021/22 financial year. EFF Mangaung Caucus Whip, Gopolang Lipale, says the municipality’s failure to produce certain documents to the Auditor General to prove the existence of some projects is disturbing. Lipale says, “Our people here in Mangaung, unfortunately, are living in a place where tomorrow Mangaung might even not have money to pay for service delivery, to even their own workers. So now Mangaung, one can just term it that it is on the autopilot, whereby there is instability and there is nothing that can be done.” VIDEO | Mangaung financial decay blamed on lack of proper documentation:
