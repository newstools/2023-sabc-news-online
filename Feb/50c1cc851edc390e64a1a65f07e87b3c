The police spokesperson Joseph Swartbooi says they were patrolling the area on Friday when a member of the public alerted them that he had been hijacked. “The members searched the area and spotted the vehicle near to Elands Way. A high-speed chase ensued until they brought the vehicle to a halt on Symphony Way. They searched the vehicle and recovered a 9 mm Taurus pistol with ammunition. They arrested and detained the driver, a 24-year-old male on charges of possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and possession of a hijacked vehicle.” Minister Bheki Cele presents quarterly crime stats  “We will be convening an urgent engagement with relevant stakeholders to interrogate these results. As much as the law enforcement component will be discussed, there will also be a particular focus on violence prevention. We will also continue to amend the operations of our 1 200 LEAP officers that work in partnership with the City of Cape Town so that they respond directly to the current needs.”
