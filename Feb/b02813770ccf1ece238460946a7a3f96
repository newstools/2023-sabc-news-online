Motorists in the Vaal are calling on government to intervene following flooding in the area. Several roads and bridges remain closed after Saturday’s heavy downpours. In Three Rivers in Vereeniging, some houses alongside the riverbanks of the Vaal are submerged in water. A golf course is also affected. Twelve floodgates have now been opened in the Vaal Dam due to the heavy rain. Motorist Thabiso Mothobi who has been trying his best to travel around the area, under challenging circumstances says, “I’m visiting my daughter here in Vereeniging. On our way, we encountered the problem of flooding from yesterday’s (Saturday) rain. We are asking for government to intervene because this looks like a national disaster.” “This is the only route that we know. Now we have to ask for directions. So we are asking for the intervention of the national government,” adds Mothobi.
