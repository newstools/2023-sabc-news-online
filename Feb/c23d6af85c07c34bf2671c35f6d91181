The Premier of the Western Cape Alan Winde says he has requested the provincial treasury to allocate just over R1 billion to respond to the energy crisis in the upcoming three-year budget period. He says this is to respond to the short-term impact of load shedding on government services, and to secure diesel to keep essential public services running such as hospitals and schools. Winde was delivering the State of the Province address (SOPA) at the opening of the Western Cape Parliament on Thursday. The province is also looking to provide poorer households with emergency power packs that help reduce the impact of load shedding on daily tasks. pic.twitter.com/Ws6BJLYyrt — Premier Alan Winde (@alanwinde) February 16, 2023  Fight against gangsterism Winde has announced that a panel of eminent persons is being established to respond to claims that gangsters have infiltrated the police service in the Western Cape. This follows a ruling by Judge Daniel Thulare last year that some within the SAPS have been captured by gangs. The panel will include experts from the European Union, South America, and local residents who have experience in the fight against gangsterism. Winde says the provincial government will also fund lifestyle audits for the top brass of police in the province to ensure that those in charge are untarnished. Economic growth The Western Cape is setting out to grow the provincial economy by between 4 and 6% by 2035. This is to fuel and stimulate economic growth to achieve a R1-trillion provincial GDP target by 2035. Winde says this would translate into 600 000 new jobs aimed at achieving an economy that is sustainable, diverse, and thriving.
