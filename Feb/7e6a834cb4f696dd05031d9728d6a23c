Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC)  Fikile Mbalula has lashed out at what he termed greedy ANC politicians who fight over positions. Speaking at a January 8 anniversary celebration rally in Hammersdale in KwaZulu-Natal, on Sunday, Mbalula urged political office-bearers in the local and provincial government to start making a difference in the lives of the citizens they serve. Mbalula stresses that this was a year of action for the ANC. He warns underperforming ANC members that their days were numbered. “The message we have this year is one of taking decisions and acting on those decisions to make sure that people are served. If you are not working, you are lazy, go home and stay home we don’t want lazy people this year,” says Mbalula.
