Economic analyst Lebohang Pheko says the government lacks continuity in its implementation of measures aimed at addressing the country’s energy crisis. South Africa’s energy grid has been experiencing a notable collapse in generating capacity, with Eskom and government officials saying the solution lies in the construction of additional power stations and generators. However, rating agency Fitch warns that the energy crisis in South Africa could adversely affect the country’s credit rating. Pheko says the government doesn’t have a track record of executing its energy plans. “The African Development Bank has developed some of the most interesting ideas that are cutting edge. There are many energy experimental policies out there but none of these seem to be domesticated and none of these seem to be finding any possibility of being used on the ground. We seem to be rather content with re-creating different policy models which are not to great effect at all.” Additional 400 megawatts Eskom is close to contracting with energy partners for an additional 400 megawatts of power. This will be done through what is described as standard offer purchase and emergency purchase procurement agreements. That’s the word from Rudi Dicks, the head of Operation Vulindlela in the Presidency. Eskom has also indicated that good progress was being made in getting permission to begin work to fix the Kusile power station after a number of units were affected following key infrastructure damage last year.
