The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro has issued a boil-before-drink notice to its water consumers as it is introducing borehole-sourced water into the reticulation system. The Metro says it is unable to meet the water quality standard blending ratio, set out for blending water from multiple sources. This is due to the low level of the supply dams, affecting abstraction rates and reservoir levels.

We have instructed public health officials to immediately increase the daily testing of our water. Therefore NMB is advising residents to boil tap water before consuming it. With the addition of unblended water in our articulation system, low dam levels and fluctuating reservoir waters, the quality of water is constantly changing and cannot always be 100% guaranteed.”  NMBM consumers cautioned to boil water before consumption.#NMBM#SaveWaterNow pic.twitter.com/Drs2RGHhAn — Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (@NMandelaBaymuni) February 28, 2023
