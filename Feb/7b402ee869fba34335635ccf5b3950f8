Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee Chairperson Khaya Magaxa says they are concerned regarding Transnet’s plan to give its slots to the private sector due to non-profitability.

There has been an over 1000% spike in cable theft over the last five years, with 100km of cables being stolen every month. Security costs have escalated the state-owned entity’s cost to revenue.
