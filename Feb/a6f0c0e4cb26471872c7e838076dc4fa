Honeydew Ridge residents on Johannesburg’s West Rand have taken to the streets to protest, after nearly a week without electricity. The protest is one of several that are being held on the streets of various suburbs in the area as community members express increasing frustration with what they say are broken promises by Johannesburg’s City Power and their local representative. The protesters have blocked a main road with dustbins and are being watched closely by the police. A resident, only known as Diedre, is venting her frustration. “Community protests have been on the rise even as civil society groups gear up to take the government to court over load shedding.”
