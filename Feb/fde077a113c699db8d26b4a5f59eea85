Alleged Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe will be sent for mental observation. His defence team has been given time to determine where he will be sent for observation. Mafe briefly appeared in the Cape Town High Court today as part of pre-trial proceedings. Mafe missed three previous court appearances after he refused to leave his prison cell. He was arrested after a fire broke out at Parliament a year ago. The blaze destroyed huge parts of the National Assembly. He faces several charges including arson, terrorism and theft. The case has been postponed until the 24-th of this month. Mafe remains in custody. In the video below, reflecting on Parliamentâ€™s fire a year later:
