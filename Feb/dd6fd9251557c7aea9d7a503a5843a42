Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, says Saturday’s E-prix race in Cape Town showcased the country’s ability to move toward the use of renewable energy. The Mother City successfully hosted the first E-prix in sub-Saharan Africa. The E-prix features top of the line electric racing cars competing on a race circuit. Formula E cars raced through the Green Point and Waterfront precincts. It is estimated to have generated around R2 billion in direct and indirect investment for the province. Winde says the E-prix generated its own renewable energy which was used to power the race. “For us it was also about making sure that we wheel wind power through the grid system to charge the batteries, their own systems using bio-fuel and data management. And also, the week before which held Green Africa conferences and brought energy experts to talk about the just energy transition. So it’s all about green, all about the future and all about the economy.”
