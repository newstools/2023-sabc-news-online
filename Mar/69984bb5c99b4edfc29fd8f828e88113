During her trial together with the 20 other accused, Gumede’s lawyer advocate Jay Naidoo told the court that they want an interim forensic report that formed the basis for criminal charges against the accused. Gumede, former municipal manager Sipho Nzuza and some former senior municipal employees are alleged to have manipulated tender processes in favour of companies preferred by Gumede.

Advocate Naidoo further asked that the defense be furnished with minutes of a meeting where a decision to investigate the matter was taken. Tuesday’s court proceedings:
