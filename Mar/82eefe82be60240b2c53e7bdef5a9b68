President Cyril Ramaphosa says the country’s needs should guide the size and structure of government. In his weekly letter on Monday, he responds to those who criticised the addition of two new ministries – Energy and Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation – during last week’s cabinet reshuffle. Ramaphosa’s move increased the number of ministries from 28 to 30. When it comes to building a capable and developmental state, the foremost consideration is how to organise every part of government, including the executive, to effectively implement the electoral mandate. https://t.co/SimtHfqVRv pic.twitter.com/kpCmV2Hkrw — Cyril Ramaphosa  (@CyrilRamaphosa) March 13, 2023  In 2019 when he took office he reduced the number of ministries from 34 to 28. The President says instead of reducing the size of government to a head-counting exercise, evidence, experience and availability of resources must be considered. Ramaphosa says that the new ministries respond to South Africa’s current specific needs. To tackle challenges such as poverty, homelessness and illiteracy he says, a capable developmental state is critical. With the country’s needs changing over time, he says the government has to adapt and be responsive. Besides need, Ramaphosa says there must be consideration of resources available and where possible there must be a process to rationalise ministries, departments and other state entities without affecting outcomes. As I said in the State of the Nation Address, the Presidency and National Treasury will work together to rationalise government departments, entities and programmes over the next three years.https://t.co/Cg36yDvHqg — Cyril Ramaphosa  (@CyrilRamaphosa) March 9, 2023
