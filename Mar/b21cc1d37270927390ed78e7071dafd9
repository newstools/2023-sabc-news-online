He says, “Must have [a person with] laser focus, someone who will eat [and] breathes this problem, with no other competing tasks on this person’s diary. It’s an extraordinary event, [it] has catastrophic consequences if we don’t address it.” Ramokgopa says he intends on working directly with power plant managers to help resolve technical energy issues.
