The Health Funders Association says if the Competition Commission finds the three biggest private pathology laboratories guilty of colluding in their charges for COVID-19 PCR tests, they must pay back the money to its members. The group has approached the Competition Commission to request it investigate Pathcare, Ampath and Lancet. If successful, the association believes it could get back an estimated R1-billion which 35 medical aid schemes, which are among the complainants, had paid out.
