An investigation is under way into a shooting incident in Westbury, Johannesburg, on Sunday. Police say unknown suspects shot one person in the upper body in the evening. However, they say the circumstances surrounding the shooting will form part of their investigation. Last week Police Minister Bheki Cele visited the area after residents complained that they were living in fear due to the ongoing gang violence in which more than ten people were killed recently. The shootings are continuing despite the deployment of a specialised task force to the area for the next three months in an attempt to combat the increase in crime including gang violence.
