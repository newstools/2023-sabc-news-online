Six accused are expected to appear in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court in Cape Town on Thursday in connection with the kidnapping of an 8-year-old girl from Gatesville. The child was snatched while on her way to school in November 2022 and located and found in a shack in Khayelitsha days later. It is expected that the bail application will get underway when they appear. The accused face several charges including kidnapping, attempted extortion and robbery with aggravating circumstances. Charges against two other accused have since been withdrawn. VIDEO | A child goes missing every five hours in SA:
