Suspected ISIS militants have killed at least 19 people and burned a medical facility in a raid at a village in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Two regional officials say the attack occurred in the village of Kirindera in North Kivu province, in the early hours of Monday morning. It happened a few kilometres from another attack on a village in which 35 people were killed. President Ramaphosa sends a strong message regarding situation in eastern DRC:  The army blamed last week’s attack on the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group based in eastern DRC. The group has pledged an alliance with ISIS. The ADF was created in Uganda before moving to eastern Congo in the 1990’s and has been blamed for thousands of deaths in the last decade. The killings have continued despite efforts by the army, which is also fighting the rebel group M23, whose offensive in recent months has displaced 600,000 people. Congo says the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which Rwanda denies. UN delegation visits DRC
