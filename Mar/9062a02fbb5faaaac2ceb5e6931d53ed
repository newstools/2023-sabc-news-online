Manyoni spoke about his comrade and childhood friend, “We went to primary school together, we went to senior school together and even went to high school together. He got politically conscientised at a very young age, simply because of the conditions we were living in Tumahole. We were very poor and that brought the spirit that we need to change our lives. We were influenced by Fezile Dabi, who conscientised us.” Tributes pour in for education MEC Tate Makgoe: Sello Dithebe
