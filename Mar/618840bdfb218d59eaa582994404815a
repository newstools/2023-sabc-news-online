ANC MP Bheki Radebe says the former Eskom CEO, Andre De Ruyter, needs to appear before the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) to provide further information on alleged criminal activities at the power utility. A number of organisations are calling on De Ruyter to reveal the identity of ministers and officials that he, during a recent television interview, indicated are involved in corruption at Eskom. Video: President Ramaphosa calls on de Ruyter to lay charges over Eskom corruption  Radebe says those allegedly involved need to account to SCOPA. “As SCOPA, we need to understand exactly how many people are involved. We want to get a sense and understanding from the former CEO, having appeared before parliament, why were all these allegations not brought to our attention? Why were we not informed that there are certain ministers whose information was brought to their attention and they did not act? Those ministers need to be summoned to appear before us.”
