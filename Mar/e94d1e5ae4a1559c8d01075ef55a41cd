ATM leader, Vuyo Zungula, says parliament should hold President Cyril Ramaphosa accountable while other authorities are still investigating Phala Phala. This is in the wake of the South African Revenue Service (Sars) confirming that it has no record of the alleged 580 thousand US dollars paid to Ramaphosa in 2019. Opposition parties have called for the president’s resignation over Sars findings that there is no record that Hazim Mustafa, the Sudanese businessman who paid cash to Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm, declared the money he had brought into the country. SARS says it has no record of Mustafa’s large sum of foreign currency he brought into South Africa:  The DA obtained this information directly from Sars following a request submitted in terms of the Promotion of Access to Information Act (POPI). Zungula who has been vocal in the call for the President to vacate his office, says the president may have been a beneficiary for money that was illegally obtained. “Firstly, that report by the independent panel, there’s nothing wrong with it. It’s a summary of bigger crimes committed by president … the Reserve Bank confirmed and also this confirmation by Sars also confirms that there are bigger criminal activities because this report of this morning clearly shows us that the president is a beneficiary of money illegally obtained, and he did not do what was expected of him to ensure that he is not receiving money from criminal activities.” Zungula says the National Assembly should execute its mandate of holding the president to account. Meanwhile, all eyes will be on President Cyril Ramaphosa when he announces the new members of his executive. The big one is that of Paul Mashatile, who will be officially appointed the country’s new deputy president following the resignation of David Mabuza last month.
