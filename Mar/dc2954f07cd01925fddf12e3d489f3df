The High Court in Cape Town has granted a final interdict against the Congress of Democratic Taxi Associations (Codeta) preventing them from obstructing, interfering and stopping the transporting of learners within the Western Cape. Codeta has over the past few weeks been blocking the transporting of over 5 000 learners to schools in Mfuleni, Delft and Khayelitsha, demanding that the Education Department awards the scholar contract to them.

It’s also putting an end to the hollow claims by Codeta that they are somehow not involved in the criminal action they announced they are taking, we trust the South African Police Service will ensure that the interdict is enforced and any further disruptions are prevented.”
