Russia’s Prosecutor General said on Monday that it was labelling German-based anti-corruption group Transparency International an “undesirable organisation”. “It was found that the activities of this organisation go beyond the declared goals and objectives,” it said. The label “undesirable” has been applied to dozens of foreign groups in Russia since it started using the classification in 2015, and often serves as a precursor to the Justice Ministry banning an organisation outright.
