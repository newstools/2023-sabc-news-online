Russiaâ€™s central bank on Monday extended for six months some emergency capital controls it introduced after Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine last year and the West imposed sweeping sanctions on Moscow. In a move flagged by Governor Elvira Nabiullina last week, the central bank said it was extending restrictions on the withdrawal of foreign currency until the 9th of September 2023, as well as a ban on some commission charges that banks can levy.
