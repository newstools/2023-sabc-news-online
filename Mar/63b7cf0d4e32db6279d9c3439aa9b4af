South Africa’s new Electricity Minister Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa has described the public’s anger at continued rolling blackouts and corruption allegations as justified. On Monday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced changes to the Cabinet, increasing the portfolios from 28 to 30. Ramokgopa will work with Eskom and other stakeholders on the urgent implementation of the Energy Action Plan. He was the Mayor of Tshwane between 2010 and 2016. But most recently, he headed efforts to drive infrastructure investment in the Presidency. Ramokgopa has outlined his priorities, including working to resolve energy generation issues. “I can talk to you about corruption this and that but the country is impatient. It is not about diagnosing the problem. I must say to the country, this is how we are going to resolve it, these are the resources that are required to resolve it. This is how I am going to deploy the resources and this is the period that it is going to take.” “But just to talk [about] corruption is unhelpful. We are beyond describing the problem. We are at the stage of implementing. The impatience and the anger by our people are justified and understandable,” adds Ramokgopa.
