Five men accused of killing an ANC councillor and a party member in Mokopane are expected to appear in the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo today. Councillor Vaaltyn Kekana and ANC Sub-regional Secretary Ralph Kanyane of the troubled Mogalakwena Local Municipality were shot in Mokopane in 2019. The fifth accused will join them for the first time, after his arrest last month. Three more people were arrested and charged earlier this week for the killings.
