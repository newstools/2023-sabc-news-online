Minister Nzimande briefs media on threats against Fort Hare university staff:  Meanwhile, the Fort Hare SRC President, Siphokazi Mbalo, says they are not happy with the way the case has been handled. “As the SRC and the students we are not satisfied because we feel like by now, there’s supposed to be a lead as to who did this and the motive as to why. Because it’s really putting us in a compromising position. Because it is very hard for us to comment on this issue because we don’t know what was the motive behind the assassination of the VC. So we want the perpetrator to be arrested and we want the motive, why did he do what he did.” Police are investigating, but no arrests have been made yet. Fort Hare will hold a memorial service for Mboneli Vesele on Thursday. – Reporting by Sidima Mfeku
