Every five years, the African National Congress (ANC) holds a Policy Conference and a National Conference. Prior to the National Conference, there is a Policy Conference where delegates debate and discuss policy proposals. Following the conclusion of the Policy Conference, the branches receive these discussion documents for additional feedback. The Policy Conference does not make decisions; rather, they are approved for implementation at the National Conference by the ANC.  ANC resolutions  by SABC Digital News
