According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), tigers are categorized as endangered species as there are only 4500 left in the wild. Of those, around 1 500 are in captivity in South Africa. As of Wednesday, one can assume that we are now left with 1499 tigers with the killing of Sheba by authorities. For the past couple of days, Joburgers more specifically those in the south of Gauteng had been on edge with the news of escaped, the eight-year-old female tiger named Sheba – the news turned grim when reports came that the tiger had attacked a man, killed a dog, pig and a deer. However, these fears were soon lulled when Sheba was shot and killed on Wednesday morning. Love Lions Alive Sanctuary says there is a loophole in the law, as there is no legislation in place permitting the owning of a tiger. LISTEN:
