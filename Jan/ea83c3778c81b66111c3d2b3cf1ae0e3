One person has been killed and five are recovering in hospital under police guard following a collision in Umbilo Road south of Durban. It is believed the suspects were involved in a house robbery in the Malvern and Pinetown areas in December. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Robert Netshiunda says a high-speed chase ensued when the suspects attempted to flee from police. “The Umbilo Task Team were patrolling along the Fielden Drive in Umbilo when they spotted a vehicle with six occupants. The vehicle was positively identified as one which was reported to have been involved in a house robbery in the Malvern area earlier in the day. With the suspects defying police’s instruction to stop, a high-speed chase ensued. The suspects drove into the oncoming traffic on Umbilo Road and collided head-on with a horse and trailer. The driver of the suspect’s vehicle succumbed to his injuries at the scene and the other five suspects were arrested and taken to hospital for treatment.” #sapsKZN Umbilo #SAPS Task Team members arrested 5 suspects for house robbery.
