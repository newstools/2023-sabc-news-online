Several measures are being taken in rebuilding massive pipelines supplying the eThekwini metro with water, to make it more resilient against flooding. This after two of the pipelines from Nagle Dam to the Durban Heights water treatment plant were smashed by huge boulders or washed away in last year’s floods. Extensive damage to infrastructure of both the eThekwini municipality and bulk water supplier Umgeni Water left many parts of the metro without water. Umgeni Water alone sustained damage of R900 million. Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu says repairs to one of the pipelines were finished at the end of last year, while the second pipeline should be in operation by June and the pipeline crosses little streams, that section is being encased in reinforced concrete. As an organization, we are happy to have met our target. Which was 22 December 2022 to restore aqueduct No 1.#KZNFLOODS#InftrastructureRestoration#aqueduct 1 & 2 pic.twitter.com/Vd5Fb0T7in — Umgeni Water (@UmgeniWater) December 27, 2022  ”What they did is they changed from what was done before where the pipe was put on the riverbed. They have now taken it up via pillars across the river and there is quite a safe space between the water flowing. Even if that river can be full, it’s quite safe. The pillars are strong,” says Mchunu. Meanwhile, a refurbished 340 million litre reservoir at the Durban Heights water treatment plant has also come into operation to supply water to high-lying areas in the north of Durban like KwaMashu, Inanda, Ntuzuma and parts of Phoenix. Umgeni Water spokesperson Shami Harichunder says, ”This is extremely good news for the city of Durban. It will bring into the equation additional water, it will improve the security of water supply. It will mean eThekwini will have access to additional water from aqueduct 1 and reservoir 3. Really, today is an important day for Umgeni Water. We’ve waited quite a long time for this day to arrive.”
