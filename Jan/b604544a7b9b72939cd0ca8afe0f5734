The City of Johannesburg council is expected to convene any time from now to table the minority parties motions of no confidence in the Mayor Mpho Phalatse. Minority parties in the City of Johannesburg are confident that their motions will succeed. The governing multi-party coalition in Johannesburg will have a tough task fighting the motion to remove Phalatse after talks broke down between the DA and the Patriotic Alliance (PA). The Joburg council is made up of 270 seats and for the motion to succeed 136 votes would be needed. The chairperson of the minority parties Margaret Arnolds says they are expecting to vote with the ANC and the EFF. “The issue of which candidate we support would be totally from the minorities and the minorities would decide. So, I think we’re going to see something different time. We could be having a minority candidate that would be the mayor in the City of Johannesburg,” explains Arnolds.
