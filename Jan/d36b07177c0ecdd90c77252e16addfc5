Cape Town residents with solar systems will soon be able to sell their excess electricity to the metro to boost the capacity of the local authority’s energy network and combat rolling blackouts. The Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis says the city has received approval from national government to pay households for the electricity they contribute to the metro’s grid. Hill-Lewis says this is a major step towards stabilising electricity supply in Cape Town. “We have received the exemption from the national treasury that we asked for many months ago. We finally received feedback on that and the news is positive. We have exemption and that means that we can start to put in place a system in which people with solar panels on their roof can feed power back to the city and be paid in cash for that power.” Video: Authorities in Cape Town want the city to be free of rolling blackouts
