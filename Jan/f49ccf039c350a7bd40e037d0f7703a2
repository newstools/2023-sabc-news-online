The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) member David Mahlobo, has pleaded with party members to accept the final results of the 9th Free State conference in Bloemfontein. This comes after almost half of the delegates abandoned the conference, with some claiming that elections were rigged. Some of the supporters of Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela said they were not entirely satisfied with the elections results.
