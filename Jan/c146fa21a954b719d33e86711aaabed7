The City of Johannesburg’s Mayor Dr Mpho Phalatse has been ousted in a motion of no confidence. The motion was tabled in council on Thursday afternoon. 140 councillors voted for the motion while 120 councillors voted against it. The motion was tabled by three parties – the African Transformation Movement, African Independent Congress (AIC) and Al-Jamah-Ah party. Several past motions of no-confidence failed. Although one did succeed briefly, the Johannesburg High Court later ruled that it was illegally constituted. Livestream:
