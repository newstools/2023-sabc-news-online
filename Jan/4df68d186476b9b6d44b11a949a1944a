They were paying tribute to the human rights lawyer. In a statement released they have described Maseko as ceaseless and fearless human-rights lawyer. “An outspoken critic of the regime in his beloved Eswatini, Thulani had all too long suffered at the hands of a heedless regime. But he lived by the motto: My head is bloody, but unbowed … I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul. Sadly and to the shame of those engaged in the administration of justice in his country, all too often he was a lone beacon of light.” Accordingly Freedom Under Law, has suggested that it would be fitting if the Law Society of Eswatini were to mark his passing by observing the 21st of January every year as a day of mourning his death and rededication to the Rule of Law. Freedom Under Law adds, “To his widow and family we express our grateful condolences. They have paid a bitter price on behalf of all who try to serve the principles for which their dear one lived.” Legal fraternity reacts to Human Rights lawyer Thulani Maseko shot dead in Eswatini:
