This comes as inland schools open today for the academic year. Chiloane earlier said over 1 300 grade one and grade eight learners who applied online, have not yet been placed. He says plans include procuring additional mobile classes and learning spaces. Scores of frustrated parents whose children have not been placed for the Grade One academic year were turned away at the Danie Malan Primary School in Pretoria North earlier this week. The incident allegedly sparked clashes between black and white parents over placements. A parent who was turned away at the school expressed his frustrations. “I can tell you now that this [has] got to a way that it escalated to racism. And we were told that this is not your school. You must go build your own school. They gave us a bogus court order. We [are] not satisfied with the response because [we were] not even given an opportunity to speak to the principal directly,” one parent explains.
