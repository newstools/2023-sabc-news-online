It is currently prevalent in the United States and according to the World Health Organisation, the sub-variant is XBB.1.5 is the most transmissible. The Stellenbosch University’s Network for Genomics Surveillance detected the variant which has been described as the most transmissible to date. The Health Department says it is still gathering more information about the variant including its transmissibility. Dr Letlape says they will wait for the department to release the information. “Hopefully, they will come forward with the information of who was the patient, where was it was found, where did the patient come from, did the patient travel and that the precautionary measures of isolation and tracing of contacts will begin. What we do not want is to begin when the virus has spread beyond what is reasonable.” VARIANT XBB.1.5 by SABC Digital News
