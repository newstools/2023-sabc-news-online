Labour Minister Thulas Nxesi is to visit the four farms on Monday where people died in the Kakamas region in the Northern Cape due to heatstroke. Seven farm workers died last week amid the persistent heat wave gripping most parts of the country. Temperatures over the past few weeks in the region peaked between 40 and 50 degrees. It is also harvest season in the area and farm workers are forced to work the vineyards. Two farm workers survived the ordeal and told SABC News that they are lucky to be alive. The Labour Department launched an investigation and a report is expected to be released soon. Exercise caution The Northern Cape Health Department has called on the public to exercise caution amid hot weather conditions and monitor for heat stroke symptoms. The province’s Acting Head of Department, Riaan Strydom says, “For the next two weeks the average temperatures will not be less than 40 degrees. So the common signs are dry skin where you don’t sweat, problems with movement and coordination, balance issues, intensive sweating, low or high blood pressure, seizures and comas. The ways you can prevent it is by wearing clothing that is protective, wearing a hat, drink enough fluids. “ VIDEO: NC Heat stroke survivors share their trauma:
