Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Blade Nzimande says the government has set aside R47 billion to fund an estimated 900 000 NSFAS beneficiaries this academic year. This represents a 7% increase in the number of students eligible for NSFAS bursaries over the fiscal year 2022. The Minister says out of these qualifying students, over 60% of undergraduate students in our public university system receive support. Over 90% of students in TVET colleges also benefit from bursaries. “The figures provided above illustrate just how important the financial aid provisions from the State distributed through NSFAS have been over the years,” Nzimande elaborates by dividing the 2023 student allowances for university and TVET students as follows: University students’ allowances · University managed and catered students will receive a R5,460 learning materials allowance and an accommodation allowance capped at R61,500.
