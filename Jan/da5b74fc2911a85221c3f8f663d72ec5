The City of Cape Town has appealed to the public to continue celebrating the festive season responsibly. The city says its Public Emergency Communication Centre recorded just over 1 000 calls in the last week. That is less than a third compared to the previous week.

If everyone behaves responsibly, this festive season will be memorable for all the right reasons,” said Smith. Capetonians watch traditional festive lights being switched on:
