A police officer who raped her son is expected to appear in the Marble Hall Magistrates’ Court in Limpopo. The officer, whose details cannot be divulged to protect the minor’s identity, faces several sexual offense charges. These include rape, sexual grooming as well as the creation and distribution of pornography. A video of the woman raping her then ten year old son was circulated on social media and it is believed that the video was recorded three years ago. National Commissioner of Police Fannie Masemola described the officer’s actions as unacceptable. Masemola says, “Crime is crime, whether it is being committed by whoever and in this case remember we have done the necessary as the SAPS. We arrested her ourselves and took the report.”
