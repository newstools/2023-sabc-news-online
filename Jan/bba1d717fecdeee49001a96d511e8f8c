The eThekwini Municipality Council meeting on Thursday was called off after African National Congress (ANC) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillors failed to show up. The meeting, which was organised at Durban’s Inkosi Albert Luthuli Convention Centre, was expected to fill the vacancy of Deputy Mayor after the removal of Philani Mavundla from Abantu Batho Congress last month. Speaker of the council, Thabani Nyawose says both ANC and EFF councillors went to their respective caucus meetings and never returned for the meeting to start. “But on why the ANC is not here I don’t know, what I have been told when interacting with the whip of the ANC they said they are having a caucus. When I was calling Mr. Khambule of the EFF, he told me the same thing that, “speaker we are concluding the discussions in our caucus”. I have no other explanation except what I have been told by the whips of the parties on why they are not here”. #sabcnews Pic Credit: Vusi Makhosini.
