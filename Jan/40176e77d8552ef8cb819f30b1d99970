The Broadcasting and Electronic Media Workers Union (BEMAWU) is suggesting amendments to the Broadcasting Act in order to do away with a board at the SABC. BEMAWU President, Hannes Du Buisson, says the public broadcaster may not need a board in future should a new tax be introduced that sustains it. He says a board would be costly for taxpayers. The public broadcaster has been without a board for more than 100 days. The term of the previous team ended on the 15th of October last year. The parliamentary process of recommending the 12 most suitable candidates was concluded by the National Assembly in December. President Cyril Ramaphosa is yet to appoint the incoming board. Du Buisson elaborates. “If the SABC can run without a board, maybe this is also then the appropriate time to change the Broadcasting Act and to get rid of the board that in any event is a cost to the taxpayers. The board is costing the taxpayers and if tax is going to be introduced, it will purely be tax money and no longer advertising money that will fund the SABC as such or TV license money. The board is costing the SABC quite a few millions a year. We cannot see whilst we are paying directors of the SABC similar amounts and even more that they would not be able to manage the SABC on their own.”
