Action SA in Limpopo has opened a case of vandalism against the African National Congress (ANC) at the Seshego police station, outside Polokwane. This after Action SA’s election posters were damaged. The Limpopo Action SA leader, Sello Lediga, alleges that some ANC members have been caught on camera removing and damaging posters from lamp poles in Moletjie. Action SA, ANC and EFF are expected to contest by-elections in ward 10 in Moletjie later this month. The matter has also been reported to the electoral commission. ANC is yet to comment. Lediga says the law must take its course. “The ANC has long evolved into a big criminal enterprise, trying every trick in the book to cling to power. This is expressed when the ANC thugs are pictured climbing the lamp posts to illegally remove Action SA posters because this disgraced ruling party has long lost the support of the people and the docket has been opened and we’re expecting the police to investigate the matter in terms of the law.”
