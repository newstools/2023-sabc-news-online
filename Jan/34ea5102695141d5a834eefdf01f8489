The seventh witness in the rape trial of the Rivers of Living Waters’ church leader Stephen Zondo will face another day of cross-examination in the High Court in Pretoria. The defence team which Advocate Piet Pistorius will lead will cross-examine the witness about an alleged sexual abuse encounter which took place in Zondo’s church office in 2017. She told the court that she opened a case at the Evaton police station in the Vaal in May 2019. The defence has discredited her evidence, arguing that she was part of the church’s former members who conspired against Zondo to falsely accuse him. Zondo is facing ten charges, eight of which include rape. VIDEO:  Defence cross-examines fourth rape survivor on January 20, 2023:
