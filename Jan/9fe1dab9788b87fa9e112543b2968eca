ActionSA caucus leader in the eThekwini Municipality Zwakele Mncwango has appealed to political parties to work together to improve the lives of the metro’s residents. This follows the collapse of the municipality’s council meeting last week after the ANC and EFF councillors failed to attend. The meeting was expected to fill the vacancy of deputy mayor after the ousting of Philani Mavundla of Abantu Batho Congress last month. Mncwango says a lack of co-operation among parties is hampering the delivery of basic services in communities around Durban. “We are calling on all smaller parties to unite and really protect eThekwini municipality from collapsing. All we are saying is there is no use for smaller parties to keep fighting for positions at the expense of eThekwini Municipality. We are saying, let’s unite and support these three parties which is the DA, EFF and IFP for the sake of eThekwini Municipality. We can really unite, we can rebuild eThekwini, we can save eThekwini, that’s all we asking.”
