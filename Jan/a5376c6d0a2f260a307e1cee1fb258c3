Individual results are available on the national department’s website. Maynier explains, “Principals at schools across the country only receive the results on the morning of the 20th with the statement of results for each learner. They must then check the results and report or confirm any anomalies that they may find. They can then advise their learners not to panic if there is an error and how to resolve it. Principals can also identify learners that may require additional support.” A prayer meeting was held yesterday for the Class of 2022 at Hillcrest Secondary School in Mossel Bay. Community leader, Dawid Kamfer, says those who have not performed as well as they would have liked, need support. Matric Results 2022 | There’s improvement in Basic Education: Prof. Solomon Mawela
