The Mayor of eThekwini in KwaZulu-Natal, Mxolisi Kaunda, will face his first vote of no confidence in the provincial legislature next week. Kaunda is accused of being behind the collapse of the municipality after sewage spillage into rivers and the sea caused a drop in tourism. Councillors from Active Citizens Coalition proposed the tabling of the motion. The former deputy mayor, Philani Mavundla from Abantu Batho Congress says they will support the motion. “During December of 2021, there were days when the beaches of Ethekwini were closed – that was before the floods. Exactly the same thing happened again in December 2022.  We still have sewage going into our rivers and down to the sea. Now maybe the best thing to do is to remove the leadership and put somebody else that may take our environment and our people serious.” Interview with Philani Mavundla from Abantu Batho Congress: 26 January 2023
