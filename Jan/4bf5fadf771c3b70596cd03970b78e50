Letting them know that irrespective of what the results are, you here to support them. You here to help them navigate those options because there are so many options. I think often, a lot of us get scared because we like oh my goodness what degree are we going to go into, what are we going to do in the next year. But often the teenager is really young, so it can be that they might leave a gap here, they might re-write their exam they might redo matric.” Matric results Meanwhile, the education quality assurance body Umalusi has sought to clarify the much talked about delays in the release of the 2022 matric results. The body has attributed this to the COVID-19 pandemic which hit the country in 2020. It says schools started late in 2022 due to the impact of the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 which saw disruptions in teaching, examinations and standardisation of results. Private school results are set to be released on Wednesday and public schools on Thursday. The education quality assurance body told the media in Pretoria that it had approved the release of the 2022 matric results.
