Five protesters were arrested after blocking the N12 between Warrenton and Kimberley in the Northern Cape. The suspects, one of whom is a woman, face charges of public violence. Police say over 200 protesters took their grievances to the streets following the Magareng Municipality’s decision to disconnect electricity from residents whose accounts are in arrears. The provincial police spokesperson, Sergio Kock says, “Protestors barricaded the N12 and other roads in Warrenvale with rocks and burning tyres. Protestors formed in groups of about 200 but were dispersed with the use of rubber bullets and stun grenades.  Five men and one female were arrested for public violence. Police are still monitoring the situation.”
