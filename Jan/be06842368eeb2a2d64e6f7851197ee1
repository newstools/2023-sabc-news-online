The extradition case of a Mozambican national suspected to be a kidnapping kingpin will continue in the Tembisa Magistrate’s Court in Ekurhuleni on Monday. Fifty-year-old Ishmael Nangi is alleged to be linked to multiple kidnappings in South Africa and Mozambique in which ransom demands have been made. He was arrested a week ago at an upmarket estate in Centurion, south of Pretoria.

Nangi’s legal team intends to oppose the intended extradition. #sapsHQ A multidisciplinary team led by members of the Trilateral Planning Cell and INTERPOL pounced on an upmarket estate in Centurion where they arrested an alleged kingpin wanted for #Kidnapping cases where ransom demands were made in Mozambique.
