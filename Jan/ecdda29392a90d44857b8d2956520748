The African National Congress (ANC) has accused the Democratic Alliance (DA) of harbouring an agenda to divide the governing party with regard to the direction the country should take in dealing with energy issues. This follows the DA’s march past the ANC headquarters, Luthuli House, in Johannesburg on Wednesday. The DA has blamed the ANC’s cadre deployment policy for the country’s worsening energy crisis. The convenor of the ANC Youth League Task Team Nonceba Mhlauli addressed several league members. “What we have seen in recent weeks is an attack on our national chairperson (Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe) by the very racist DA and the very racist media. The liberals that have decided that they want to redirect attention from the Public Enterprises Minister [Pravin Gordhan] to the Minister of Minerals and Energy.” “They are trying to divide the ANC government based on their factional and economic interest with the renewals energy lobby. We are here to say to the DA, we are watching them and that renewable energy lobby will not work,” adds Mhlauli. In the video below, DA marches to Luthuli House:
