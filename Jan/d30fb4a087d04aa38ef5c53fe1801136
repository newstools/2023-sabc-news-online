The Gauteng Department of Education says it has identified buildings that could be used as satellite schools to accommodate learners who are yet to be placed through its online system. Some schools can no longer admit grade 1 and 8 learners due to overcrowding. Last week the department said about 500 Grade 1 and 8 learners were yet to be placed. Close to 300 000 learners have been admitted through the department’s online system since October last year.
