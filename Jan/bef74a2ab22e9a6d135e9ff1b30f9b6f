The Public Enterprise Minister Pravin Gordhan says law enforcement agencies are looking at about 2000 cases related to criminal activities at Eskom. Last year, Eskom made several key arrests related to the theft of coal, and diesel and one case of sabotage. Speaking at an energy dialogue that the African National Congress (ANC) hosted at the University of Johannesburg on Wednesday, Gordhan painted a grim picture of the state of affairs at Eskom. He says there is a serious lack of accountability and a dysfunctional culture. Gordhan says, “The engineering discipline has been badly diluted. There is a lack of routine and proper plan maintenance of the right quality. There is a skills exodus that has to be dealt with as I pointed up, there is no proper funding available for outages and maintenance.” “There’s criminality around and in Eskom itself. So the level of corruption is huge around each power station and that is causing a serious problem whether it’s in respect of coal or fuel or buying of counterfeit parts, and indeed sabotage as well,” he adds.
