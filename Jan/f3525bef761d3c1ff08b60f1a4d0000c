Two sisters who allegedly killed their mother for an insurance pay-out in Barberton are expected to appear in the High Court in Mbombela in Mpumalanga on Monday. Sixty-two-year-old Wanter Dlamini was found dead in a nearby veld in the area in January 2020. It is reported that one of the daughters, Nonhlanhla Mthunywa, asked her mother to visit her. When she arrived at her daughterâ€™s place, two men allegedly kidnapped, assaulted and raped her while a friend held her down. They allegedly also strangled the woman to death, wrapped her body in a blanket and later dumped her in the veld.
