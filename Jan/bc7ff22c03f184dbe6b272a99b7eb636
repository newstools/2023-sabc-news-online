The Department of Education in the Northern Cape says it is hoping to resolve the learner transport crisis in and around Kuruman by the end of the month. At least 900 learners are struggling to get to school due to a lack of transport. The problem has affected learners from at least six rural villages since schools re-opened last week. The service provider has withdrawn his 16 buses due to a deadlock in fare negotiations with the provincial education department. The MEC Zolile Monakali says the scholar transport provider has made unreasonable demands. “The service provider gave notice of his intention to terminate his services two days prior to the opening of the schools. The service provider submitted a request for an increase to R200 000 each. The increase to R200 000 for each of the buses is not only unaffordable but also unreasonable,” adds Monakali.
