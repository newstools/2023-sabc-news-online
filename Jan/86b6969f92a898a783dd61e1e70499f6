U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken held talks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sision on Monday during a three-day visit to the Middle East that comes during a flare-up of violence between Israel and the Palestinians. In Cairo, Blinken is meeting Sisi and Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, and is expected to address regional issues including attempts to prelaunch a political transition in Sudan and the deadlock between rival factions in Libya. Blinken heads later on Monday to Jerusalem, where he will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu amid concern at home and abroad over the policies of Netanyahuâ€™s new right-wing government. Blinken will also travel to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
