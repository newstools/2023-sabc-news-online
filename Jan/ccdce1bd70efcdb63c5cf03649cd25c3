The multi-million rand asbestos case against former ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has been postponed to May. Magashule and his co-accused made a brief appearance before the Free State High Court for a pre-trial hearing this morning. Magashule is among 18 accused people and companies facing more than 70 charges of fraud, corruption, money laundering. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of the more than R255-million asbestos roof removal contract. The court precinct was not a hive of activity as was the case in the previous appearances. Magashule, businessman, Edwin Sodi, and the former Human Settlements director-general, Thabani Zulu, are challenging the legality of their charges in the Supreme Court of Appeal. Live stream below:
