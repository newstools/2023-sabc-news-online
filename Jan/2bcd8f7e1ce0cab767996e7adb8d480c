Residents of Ga-Makgato village outside Senwabarwana in Limpopo have marched to the local police station demanding justice for a woman who was mauled to death by two Pit bulls. Forty three-year-old Melitha Sekole was attacked by the two dogs on her way to work two weeks ago. She succumbed to her injuries at the Pietersburg Provincial hospital. Police say the owner of the dogs has since been arrested and will make a second court appearance on Thursday.

We got reports that they arrested the owner but we are not sure because we must be told by the police” say the residents.
