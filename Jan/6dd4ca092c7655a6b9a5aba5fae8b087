Water and Sanitation Minister, Senzo Mchunu is expected to open a refurbished reservoir at Umgeni Waterâ€™s Durban Heights water treatment plant today. This plant supplies water to the northern parts of the Ethekwini metro. Umgeni Water spokesperson, Shami Harichunder says the refurbished reservoir will help alleviate water shortages in high lying areas like KwaMashu, Inanda, Ntuzuma and parts of Phoenix. Meanwhile, Harichunder says one of two pipelines feeding water from Nagle Dam to the Durban Heights plant have been fixed after the storm damage in April last year.
