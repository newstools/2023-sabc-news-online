Political parties and parents are demonstrating at the Laerskool Danie Malan in Pretoria North after frustrated parents whose children have not been placed for the Grade 1 academic year were turned away earlier this week. The incident allegedly sparked clashes between black and white parents. The EFF is also expected to go to the Departmentâ€™s District Office in Soshanguve to demand answers.
