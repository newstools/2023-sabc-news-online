The African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa says the party has reaffirmed its desire to renew itself after emerging from its 55th national conference. He was speaking during the Presidential Gala Dinner in Bloemfontein Saturday night. In 2017, the ANC resolved to renew the party after some of its members were alleged to have been involved in corrupt activities, hurting the party’s credibility. The ANC’s renewal drive has resulted in the suspension of Secretary-General Ace Magashule and the resignation of party MPs such as Vincent Smith. According to Ramaphosa, the ANC’s renewal project is unstoppable.
