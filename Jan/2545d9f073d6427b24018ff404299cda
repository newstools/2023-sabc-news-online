The African National Congress (ANC) in the Gert Sibande Region in Mpumalanga has condemned the recent killings of politicians in the area. This follows Friday’s fatal shooting of Ward 12 Councillor, Sbonelo Mthembu, Sizwe Mbingo and Sandile Khumalo in Thandukukhanya Township. It is alleged that three unknown men opened fire on them before fleeing the scene. It is the second incident in the area, two months after the Deputy Regional Chairperson was shot dead.

We were anticipating to institute a motion of no confidence in the current leadership at the municipality,” Shozi explained.
