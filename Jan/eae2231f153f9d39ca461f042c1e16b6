Thunberg was carried away by three police officers and held by one arm at a spot away from the edge of the mine and escorted back towards police vans. She was released later in the evening. She has described the mine’s expansion as a betrayal of present and future generations and accused Germany of being one of the biggest polluters in the world. The protest has highlighted growing tensions over Berlin’s climate policy with environmentalists arguing that climate goals are being neglected with a return to dirtier fuels during an energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
